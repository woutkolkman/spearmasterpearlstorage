### Description
Why have dual wielding when you need to carry a pearl for half the campaign? This mod lets you put the pearl back where it came from.. Definitely not (very) painfull.

Use it the same way other slugcats store pearls.  
Note that this mod removes part of the challenge of playing Spearmaster.

Tested on v1.9.06
